Thank you for reviewing my submission for the Backend Developer technical test. In the `solutions` folder, you will find all my answers and implementations for the various parts of the test, organized into separate subdirectories for clarity.

## Folder Structure
- **`solutions/`**
  - **`code_challenge/`**: Contains the NestJS-based to-do list backend service, fully dockerized with database connections, logging, and linting rules. See the `README.md` in this directory for detailed instructions on how to run and test it.
  - **`problem_solutions/`**: Includes the JavaScript (Node 20) solution for the array scoring problem. Refer to the `README.md` in this directory for instructions on how to run and test it.
  - **`quiz/`**: Contains the `THEORICAL_ANSWERS.md` file with my answers to the theoretical quiz questions.

## Usage Demonstrations
Below are GIFs showcasing the usage of the `code_challenge` and `problem_solutions` programs in action:

## How to Run the Solutions
For specific instructions on running and testing each part of the submission:
- Navigate to the `solutions/code_challenge/` directory for the to-do list service.
- Navigate to the `solutions/problem_solutions/` directory for the array scoring problem.

Each directory contains its own `README.md` with clear steps to set up, run, and test the code.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
